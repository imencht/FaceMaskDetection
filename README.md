# FaceMaskDetection
# Face-Mask-Detection-using-CNN
During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus. In this tutorial we will develop a machine learning project – Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python.
Real-Time Face Mask Detector with Python
We will build a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not. We will train the face mask detector model using Keras and OpenCV.

## Download the Dataset
The dataset we are working on consists of 1376 images with 690 images containing images of people wearing masks and 686 images with people without masks.

## Download the dataset: Face Mask Dataset

## Download the Project Code
Before proceeding ahead, please download the project source code: Face Mask Detector Project

## Install Pycharm
In this machine learning project for beginners, we will use Pycharm for the development

In order to use images, it isnecessary to integrate in Pycharm modules like OpenCV, tensorflow, Keras 

To create a new project click on the “new directory” tab on the right panel, it will generate a new file then new "python file", it will create a file .py

Write the code which you have downloaded

## Let’s dive into the code for face mask detector project:
We are going to build this project in two parts. In the first part, we will write a python script using Keras to train face mask detector model. In the second part, we test the results in a real-time webcam using OpenCV.

Make a python file training.py to write the code for training the neural network on our dataset.
